# Fine-tuning TrOCR on Traditional Chinese

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune the Transformer-based OCR model (TrOCR) on Traditional Chinese text using native PyTorch. The primary goal is to adapt the TrOCR model to accurately recognize and transcribe Traditional Chinese characters, making it suitable for OCR tasks specific to this language variant.

The fine-tuning process is documented in a Jupyter Notebook, which includes code for data preparation, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

## Repository Contents

- **`Fine_tune_TrOCR_on_Traditional_Chinese_using_native_PyTorch.ipynb`**: The main Jupyter Notebook that contains all the code required to fine-tune the TrOCR model on Traditional Chinese text data.
- **Data**: Instructions and code to load, preprocess, and split the dataset.
- **Model Training**: Step-by-step guide to fine-tuning the TrOCR model using native PyTorch, including setting up the training loop, loss computation, and evaluation metrics.
- **Evaluation**: Code to evaluate the model's performance using Character Error Rate (CER) and loss.
- **Prediction**: Instructions on how to use the fine-tuned model to make predictions on new data.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- **Python 3.8+**
- **PyTorch 1.10+**
- **Transformers** library from Hugging Face
- **torchvision**
- **tqdm** for progress tracking
